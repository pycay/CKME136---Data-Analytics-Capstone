# CKME136---Data-Analytics-Capstone
My capstone project for Ryerson's Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics. The project I worked on was based on an open competition project called DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread. The objective of the project was to predict the total number of cases in the testing set of Iquitos, Peru &amp; San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Here is the link to the project: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

A brief summary of the objective: 

Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce—can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?
